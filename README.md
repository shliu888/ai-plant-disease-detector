This plant disease detector utilizes deep learning and CNNs to detect which disease a plant has using deep learning and CNNs. The architecture is as follows : 

  1. Convolution layer 
  2. Max pool layer 
  3. Convolution layer 
  4. Max pool layer  
  5. Dropout layer 
  6. Fully connected layer with ReLU activation
  7. Fully connected layer with ReLU activation 

Instructions: 

1. Paste the code in detector.py into a Google Colab notebook.
2. Connect to a GPU, such as the T4 (free) or A100 GPU (paid).
3. In kaggle.com, create a new API token.
4. In Google Colab, upload the kaggle.json file when prompted
5. Enjoy! Please contact me if you have any questions or comments.
