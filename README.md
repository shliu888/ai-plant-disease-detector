This plant disease detector utilizes deep learning and CNNs to detect which disease a plant has using deep learning and CNNs. The architecture is as follows : 

  1. Convolution layer #1
  2. Max pool layer #1
  3. Convolution layer #2
  4. Max pool layer #2 
  5. Dropout layer 
  6. Fully connected layer #1 
  7. ReLU activation #1 
  8. Fully connected layer #2 
  9. ReLU activation #2 

Instructions: 

1. Paste the code in detector.py into a Google Colab notebook.
2. Connect to a GPU, such as the T4 (free) or A100 GPU (paid).
3. In kaggle.com, create a new API token.
4. In Google Colab, upload the kaggle.json file when prompted
5. Enjoy! Please contact me if you have any questions or comments.
